                        Two moms- a conservative former police officer and
                        liberal stay at home parent - meet each other outside of
                        ideological bubbles to transcend polarization and find
                        common ground… or not! Meet You Outside is a podcast
                        where different views about politics, culture, and
                        parenthood aren't just tolerated but genuinely explored
                        and respected.

                            In today's polarized landscape, MYO fills a critical
                            gap: authentic dialogue between women from different
                            political backgrounds focused on understanding
                            opposing views, not silencing them. As a former law
                            enforcement officer and mental health expert, Megan
                            would be a singular voice throughout the podcast and
                            media universe. Her perspective in dialogue with
                            Nora’s more liberal but not dogmatic outlook will
                            engage listeners across the political spectrum.

                            The target audience for MYO is politically engaged
                            Gen X, Millenial and Gen Z folks feeling exhausted
                            by partisan media. Intentionally not focusing on our
                            personal lives will allow us to have greater reach
                            across the gender gap to reach men and fathers in
                            addition to the core audience of women and mothers.
                            Representing both sides of the political spectrum
                            and the position to exist outside of those
                            definitions, we will have the ability to develop
                            Republican, Democrat, and Independent listeners.

                            We are looking to work with a podcast network,
                            rather than independently because we want to do this
                            right. We believe in expertise and know that we
                            would not be able to produce a quality podcast at
                            the level of your network, by ourselves. We really
                            believe in the purpose and reach of this concept and
                            know it can succeed with the right support. We also
                            want to be able to contribute back to an
                            organization that took a chance on us, and continues
                            to do so for other original, authentic voices in the
                            future.
